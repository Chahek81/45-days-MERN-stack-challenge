# Day 19 â€” Welcome to React: Building Your First Component

This simple demo shows how to create a functional React component using JSX in a single HTML file (no build tools).

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use your editor's Live Server).
2. The page shows a Header component rendered with React 18 and Babel (CDN).

What you'll see

- A `Header` functional component that receives `name` and `title` props.
- JSX syntax used directly in the browser via Babel standalone.
- ReactDOM's `createRoot` used to mount the app.

Notes

- This setup is for learning/demo purposes only. For production apps, use a proper bundler and transpiler (Create React App, Vite, etc).
